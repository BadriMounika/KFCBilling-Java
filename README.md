### KFC Billing System
# Description
The KFC Billing System is a streamlined solution to enhance customer experience from order to payment. It starts with a warm Entry greeting, followed by an intuitive Menu for easy item selection. The system captures Orders accurately, allows customers to choose a Service Counter, includes a Tip option, calculates and prints the Bill, and provides a Rating feature for feedback. This system prioritizes efficiency, accuracy, and customer satisfaction.
